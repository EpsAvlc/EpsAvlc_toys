# fisheye_to_pinhole

Remap fisheye camera's image to pinhole camera's image.

For more detail you can refer the article: [鱼眼相机模型与标定与重映射](https://epsavlc.github.io/2019/10/21/fisheye_calib.html)

I use the camera model in [paper(Dual-Fisheye Omnidirectional Stereo)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8206587/)
